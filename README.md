# -Consensus-from-trust-
 This is an alternative method of resisting sybil attacks and achieving consensus; it has the benefit of not “wasting” electricity like proof-of-work does.    Nodes in the network are either compliant or malicious. You will write a ​CompliantNode​ class (which implements a provided ​Node​ interface) that defines the behavior of each of the compliant nodes. The network is a directed random graph, where each edge represents a trust relationship. For example, if there is an  A → B edge, it means that Node B listens to transactions broadcast by node A. We say that B is A’s follower and A is B’s followee.
